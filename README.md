## Triangle Tracker
### Author:
Nasibo Yussuf

### Description:
Triangle tracker is an application  that will help us know whether a triangle is isosceles, equilateral, scalene or NOT a triangle at all.

It's a real cool application as it helps one to relax their mind

### Languages used:
* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS


### BDD:
#### This app is therefore expected to work as following:
* Be able to display an input button for the user.
* Display a submit and a refresh function.
* If the values entered by the user are all equal - The result should be "Equilateral triangle: All sides are equal".
* If the user enters two equal sides - The result should be "Isosceles triangle: Two sides are equal"
* If the user enter values that aren't equal - The result should be "Scalene: No sides are equal"
* And if the values entered by the user are quite unrealistic to make a triangle, the the result will be "Not a triangle"

### Setup requirements:
* Web browser
* Internet connection
